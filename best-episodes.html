        <h2>The One with the Jellyfish</h2>
        <p>A tranquil beach weekend turns tumultuous when Monica falls victim to a jellyfish sting and Ross resolves to end his new relationship to reunite with Rachel. However, Ross's lengthy 18-page letter (yes, front and back!) resurfaces lingering emotions, leading to a rollercoaster few days for the rekindled duo, culminating in yet another heated argument. Can anyone say, "Were we on a break?"</p>
        <h2>The One with Unagi</h2>
        <p>In this episode, Ross attempts to explain self-defense, "kara-TE," and "unagi" to Rachel and Phoebe, confidently asserting, "Only through genuine unagi can you anticipate any potential danger." However, they soon turn the tables on him, offering a lesson in humility and giving Ross a taste of his own medicine.</p>
